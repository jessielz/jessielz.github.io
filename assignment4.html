<h1>assignment 4</h1>
<p>
	my fourth assignment focuses on cnc milling boxes!
</p>
<h2>measuring the boards</h2>
<p>
	i measured the material using the caliphers. so one board is about 100.04mm by 71mm by 1.35mm and another board is 100.02mm by 70.30mm by about 1.40mm. these informed my designs of the boxes in Rhino and i focused on learning the dogbones etc.
</p>
<p>
	following junchao's visual tutorial, i decided to make a paper prototype of the dogbones in order to understand how they interlocked. i measured some of my pieces as 36mm by 28mm so i thought it would be 36mm x 28mm when drawing on top of the rectangle i just drew in rhino.
</p>
<p>
	i decided to follow the pattern i had just set forth and just try to make this happen. i used the circle and rectangle tools to create dogbones. initially i ran into some issues with trimming but realized that it was because i had been using boxes and spheres instead of regular ol' rectangles and circles, which interfered with the software identifying whether to trim the curve or extrusion.

<h2>acknowledgments & gratitude</h2>
<p>
  i am in particular awe and gratitude to <b>the amazing TA junchao</b> for creating such a wonderful visual tutorial that really helped me understand the steps of the milling process. junchao helped me a lot with the assignment. i should also thank <b>sara cagle</b> for coming to help me figure out how to use the milling machine and the software (bantam tools), cleaning up, and teaching me a cool trick in rhino so that i could enlarge certain lines so that pieces could fit each other snugly, as well as a staff member (a woman wearing glasses) who walked me through using the milling machine step by step.
