<h1>assignment 5: getting meshy! and lamps!</h1>
<p>
	i'm going to modify two meshes and combine these into one mesh and fix all of the things that are wrong with these meshes, hopefully they will pass aalllll the checks. and then i'm going to start making a lamp!
</p>
<h2>part 1: modifying mesh</h2>
<p>
	this is the part where it starts to feel like somthing from a horror movie. i searched for the meshes i wanted from thingaverse and i decided on two things: 
	<ol>
		<li>pochita from chainsaw man <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5573869">(link)</a></li>
		<li>random cartoon rocket <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4768369">(link)</a></li>
	</ol>
	i downloaded these two meshes (STLs) and checked if i needed to repair anything using MeshRepair.
