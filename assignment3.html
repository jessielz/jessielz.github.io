<h1>assignment 3: getting started with 3d printing!</h1>
<p>
	my third assignment is assembling the 3D printer and creating (in Rhino), slicing (in Cura), and documenting (on this webpage) the following test prints: a 2cm cube with the standard "low quality" setting, a 2cm cube with the standard "standard quality" settings, and a 2cm cube with the standard "super quality" settings.
</p>
<h2>setting up the 3d printer</h2>

<p>
	i worked with courtenay, my classmate, to set up the 3d printer. we used the <b>Ender Creality 3 3D printer</b> and relied on both the class slides, YouTube videos, and printed instructions that came with the printer. to be honest, the instructions were frustrating and clearly not designed by designers; it seemed like these instructions were designed by engineers or technical artists who didn't care about legibility. to make it easier to keep track of the different parts of the 3d printer, i wrote down the labels on neon pink sticky notes and put them on their respective parts.</p>

<p>
	some of the gotcha's we had were making sure that the ribbons and wires were in the correct places so we had to put the printer apart, adjust the parts, and then put them back together. my least favorite step was <b>step 7</b> where we had to adjust the screws multiple times to ensure that they clicked into the printer's axis.
</p>
<h2>leveling the bed</h2>
<p>
	after we finally plugged the printer in and got the screen up and running on the correct voltage level, we went to work on leveling the bed. we were really confused on how to level the bed so we watched the Thingaverse blog tutorial linked in the class assignment and the youtube video that provided the g-code. leveling the bed for the 3d printer took us about 4 hours as we struggled to figure out the steps. we noticed that the nozzle of the extruder was hitting the bed multiple times, so it wouldn't budge. i texted andy for help and found out that i needed to unscrew the P-shaped part on the Z-axis that held the extruder, move it a bit higher, and screw it back on. that made the nozzle not hit the bed as much.

<h2>test printing!</h2>
<p>
	we purchased the orange filament from the MILL in honor of the spooky season aka halloween season!!! the next step is to print some tests, and we started with the cubes.
</p>
<p>
	due to time, i decided to just 3d print my 2cm x 2cm cubes at the MILL instead... and i was able to 3d print 4 cubes! with low quality, medium quality, high quality, and low quality + concentric top/bottom settings! i chose low quality for my cube for the concentric settings because i am an impatient human and i like printing something quickly. this is something i have learned.
</p>
<p>
	the assignment asked me to 3d print cylinders, tubes, and other objects. it even asked me to 3d print a nested object! but alas, i did not have time to dedicate to these things as i was busy setting up the 3d printer and having a hard time leveling the bed. it was just... a lot of work.
