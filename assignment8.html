	<title>Assignment 7: Final Project Proposal!</title> 
	</head>
<body>
<h1>final project proposal!</h1>
<p>
	i am proposing a <b>mini foosball game</b> and i will breakdown my proposal into the following steps:
	<ol>
		<li>concept</li>
		<li>breakdown of tasks</li>
		<li>timeline with contingency plans</li>
		<li>bill of materials with sourcing schedule</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<h2>concept: mini foosball game</h2>
<p>
	when searching for ideas for the final project, i asked my roommates what i should make. one of my roomies is a teacher at a middle/high school and she offered ideas for games, like a foosball table. i thought about making a guess who? game but after some more thought, i decided that it would be more fun and interesting for me to make my own spin on a foosball game. most foosball games IRL represent players as men so i thought it would be fun to put my own spin on the foosball game. moreover, i chose to make this mini, because i simply don't have the capacity to make 22 players (11 players for one team times two teams equals 22), and i wanted to keep this simple considering the time frame and my current skillset.
</p>
<p>
	there are multiple DIY tutorials for creating foosball games, so i plan to reference these for this project! if you're not sure what a foosball game looks like, a regular foosball game looks like this:

	normally it's on a tall table so people can stand and play foosball games. meanwhile, a mini foosball game could look like this (modified for kiddos):

	i plan to design my foosball game that is more simple than the first image but more complex than the second image.

<h2>breakdown of tasks</h2>
<p>
	i sketched my concept of the mini foosball game!
</p>
<p>
	<img src="a8-concept.png"></img>
</p>
<p>
	i am imagining a few tasks:
	<ol>
		<li><b>CAD modelling:</b> foosball board for laser cutting, a mesh of a player (likely from thingiverse, would need to do some mesh editing to reduce # of polygons, scale, repair, create holes; otherwise, could create basic shapes), mold of a player</li>
		<li><b>laser cutting:</b> foosball board (2 short walls, 2 long walls, potentially ground but would most likely use flat cardboard)<li>
		</li>
		<li><b>3d printing:</b> mold of mold of 1 player</li>
		<li><b>casting:</b> mold of 1 player casted from mold of mold of 1 player, cast this 8 times to create 8 players</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<h2>timeline with contingency plans</h2>
<p>tbd</p>
<h2>bill of materials with sourcing schedule</h2>
<p>tbd</p>
<h2>stretch goals!!!!</h2>
<p>
	if by some miracle i have extra time, resources, energy, etc. i have a few stretch goals:
	<ul>
		<li>make more players so they can be substituted in</li>
		<li>make more molds of players and use decorations</li>
		<li>3d print a ball so that it looks like a soccer ball</li>
		<li>3d print other types of balls</li>
		<li>3d print rods for the game</li>
	</ul>
