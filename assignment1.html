<h1>assignment 1: modelling & laser cutting</h1>
<p>hello my first assignment is on modelling and laser cutting.</p>
<h2>research + background</h2>
<p>
  this was honestly pretty difficult since i didn't feel like i knew what i was doing with digital fabrication, so i started googling some previous assignments to see what others had done before and started brainstorming some potential patterns and designs that i could incorporate. something simple, nothing complex. i decided to start with basic shapes so i could understand the laser cutting process: circle, square, and triangle. sounds easy, right?
</p>
<h2>getting to work</h2>
<p>
  i started creating three different shapes with slots in adobe illustrator at odegaard library since it has a free version of illustrator (thank you so much, student technology fee!!) and made my way over to the MILL / the 8 to try to transfer that file. from reading previous students' work, i knew that i had to get stroke just right; it had to be centered instead of in-line. additionally, the calipher is critical to measuring the cardboard so i took advantage of the MILL / the 8's calipher to measure the cardboard that my friend graciously gifted me.
</p>
<h2>acknowledgements & gratitude</h2>
<p>
  thank you very much to <b>mabel ho</b>, my friend & neighbor, for gifting me extra cardboard so i could work on this project. thank you also to <b>andy moon</b> for the moral support. finally, shout out to the previous students and wonderful staff at the MILL / the 8 for teaching me how to use illustrator and laser cutting.
