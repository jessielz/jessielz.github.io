<h1>hello folks in hcde 533: digital fabrication!</h1>
<p>
	good evening, my name is <b>jessie zhang</b> and i am a 3rd year student in human centered design & engineering at the university of washington! i set up this webpage for hcde 533, autumn 2022. it will be an interesting experience, for sure!
</p>
<p>
	what do i want to learn? hmm. i honestly took this class because this was the only 4 credit engineering elective class available this autumn 2022 and i need it to graduate. i'm almost there! while digital fabrication interests me, i know literally nothing about it other than it involves a lot of work, time, sweat, and tears, as well as its prominent role in makerspaces... so i'm excited to make something <i>physical</i>. i hope to learn from the professor, TA, classmates, peers, staff, etc. and i also hope to make something super cool and useful and helpful! i wonder if i can incorporate speculative design in this.
</p>
<p>
	honestly, i don't know if i have much to offer my peers- but i do hope to be *~moral support~* and i hope to offer some design perspective. does that count in this class? i hope so!
</p>
<p>ta-da for now. more to come soon!!</p>
