<h1>final project: "fuseball"</h1>
<p>
	please see the <a href="assignment8.html">project proposal</a> for inspo + project plan~
</p>
<h2>the final project!</h2>
<p>
	here's the current WIP of the mini foosball table aka "fuseball"! "fuseball" is a smaller version of a popular tabletop game played by two competing players.

<h2>process</h2>
<p>
	after taking prof. nadya's feedback into consideration (which was to simplify the models i would be using for the foosball players, keeping the size of the foosball game small-ish, and casting the mold directly onto the rods), i decided to simplify my previous sketch. i drafted a new sketch. i researched foosball tables some more, and found out that a competition-size foosball table's features are 56 inches long, 30 inches wide, and 36 inches tall, so i decided to scale it down to the cardboard measurements i had. i also found that a goal size was 7" by 2.5", so i decided to scale it down.
</p>
<p>
	the sketch helped me realize that for laser cutting, i needed two "walls" with the cut-out "goals" on opposite ends that needed to fit snugly into the existing cardboard that already was foldable. i created some basic designs in rhino, inspired by the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/989544379/">box design</a> i found online. this would be for laser cutting!

<p>while creating the model, i took the measurements of the stock parts, the wooden dowel rods, and made sure that there was enough space for players to rotate the rods inside the holes.</p>

<p>i did laser cutting and then made the box (or table). i assembled it and used some wood glue (borrowed from a friend) to ensure that the pieces fit well together.</p>

<h2>3d printing! and molds!</h2>
<p>after laser cutting the box, i moved on to 3d printing and molding & casting! i started by drawing a basic shape of the player and after some consultation with junchao and sara, i decided to turn this mold into a two part mold with the top part which i named "heads" and the bottom part which i named "tails".</p>
<p>to create the mold in rhino, i created the master piece - the player - using Polyline, drew a BoundingBox with sprues and keys, split the model with a plane, deleted the face, and offset the surface of the box with OffsetSrf to add walls. i ended up spending a lot of time on this modeling compared to laser cutting the box.</p>

</p>
<p>i then 3d printed the molds.</p>

<p>and then i filled the mold of the mold with the smooth-on, which i mixed together (1:1 ratio of part A and part B into the texture of pancake batter after 3 minutes of stirring).</p>

<p>the next steps are to finish the mold and cast the players directly onto the wood dowel rods in hydrostone (leftover from previous assignment), and then assemble the foosball game pieces</p>
